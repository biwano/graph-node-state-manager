# Documentation Requirements
- The project specification is in the SPECS.md 
- **MANDATORY**: Always keep the SPECS.md file in sync with the actual code
- **WORKFLOW**: After ANY code changes that affect functionality, CLI commands, or configuration:
  1. Update SPECS.md immediately
  2. Verify all changes are documented before considering task complete
